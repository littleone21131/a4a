key pionts:-
Fixed Content: The content remains the same for all users and does not change dynamically.
Simple Structure: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without server-side processing or databases.
Fast Loading: Static files are served directly to the browser, leading to faster page loads.
Easy Hosting: Can be hosted on basic web servers or platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
Limited Interactivity: Offers minimal user interaction, primarily relying on client-side JavaScript for basic interactivity.
